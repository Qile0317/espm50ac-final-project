> Alola, Andrew Adewale, et al. "Refugee Population and Environmental Quality in Sweden and Lebanon: Is Fertility Rate Changing the Dynamics?." Social Sciences 12.4 (2023): 243.

**Summary:** The study investigates the environmental impacts of refugee populations in Sweden and Lebanon, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions. It examines the roles of fertility rates, income, and natural resource abundance in shaping these impacts over three decades. Key findings include that fertility rates exacerbate GHG emissions in both countries, while refugee populations reduce emissions in Sweden but increase them in Lebanon. Sweden’s proactive environmental values and income improvements contribute to better environmental outcomes, contrasting with Lebanon, where natural resource abundance and income growth worsen environmental quality.

**Assessment:** This source provides a empirical data-based framework for understanding how varying socioeconomic and environmental policies influence refugee populations' impacts on sustainability. The emphasis on data from 1990 to 2021 ensures comprehensiveness and that its up to date.

**Reflection:** The contrasting effects in Sweden and Lebanon can help illustrate the importance of national policies and societal values in mitigating the environmental challenges posed by population displacement.

> Hamza, Mo. "Refugees’ integration in the built environment: the Sweden case." Sustainability 13.22 (2021): 12812.

**Summary:** This paper examines Sweden’s response to the mass influx of Syrian refugees in 2015, using the REGARD Project’s needs assessment framework to evaluate integration and social cohesion. Sweden's approach was comparatively successful in Europe but still revealed systemic shortcomings. Challenges included insufficient coordination between government and NGOs, a lack of understanding of ground realities by policymakers, and the need for personalized support for refugees. The study concludes that long-term, trust-building efforts yield better results than rapid, reactive measures.

**Assessment:** This paper is valuable for exploring the nuances of refugee resettlement in Sweden, offering both practical insights and theoretical frameworks. Its multi-method approach, combining literature reviews and interviews, which adds depth and credibility. However, it focuses heavily on policy and organizational shortcomings without delving deeply into refugee experiences, which could provide a fuller picture.

**Reflection:** The findings will contribute to understanding Sweden’s approach to the integration of refugees into the environment with its limited resources, particularly the emphasis on personalized support and collaboration between communities. It also offers insights into potentially why swedes were unsatisfied with the policy and the shift towards an anti immigrant attitude nationally.

> Johansson, Mats. "Immigration-a way out of the Swedish rural population crisis?." (2016).

**Summary:** This study examines the demographic impacts of immigration on Sweden's urban and rural regions from 1970 to 2014. It highlights how refugee centers in rural areas have temporarily reversed depopulation trends, creating positive net migration in these regions. Although many refugees move to urban areas after receiving residence permits, some remain in rural communities, stabilizing population decline. Immigration has also helped mitigate aging in rural areas due to immigrants' younger age and higher fertility rates, though skewed gender ratios temper these effects.

**Assessment:** The paper has a long-term data span which adds depth, but its conclusions are perhaps not so concrete due to limitations in tracking secondary internal migration. Additionally, it does not deeply engage with qualitative aspects of immigrants' experiences or integration outcomes.

**Reflection:** This research is relevant for understanding regional disparities and the policy trade-offs between rural stabilization and urban concentration. It provides another perspective unexplored by the other sources here - potential positives of this so called immigration crisis and how it improves the living environment - even if its perhaps for the short term.
