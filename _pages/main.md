# Roots of the 2015 Refugee Crisis

The 2015 refugee crisis was driven by a combination of factors, including armed conflicts, political instability, and environmental degradation. Major crises in Syria, Afghanistan, and other regions pushed millions of people to flee their homes. Additionally, environmental factors like droughts and resource scarcity played a key role in pushing people across borders.

# Sweden’s Immigration Policy: From Open Doors to Restrictions

Sweden’s immigration policy has undergone significant transformations since 2015. Initially, Sweden was known for its open-door policy to refugees, providing asylum to tens of thousands of people. However, the aftermath of the refugee crisis saw a shift towards more restrictive immigration measures.

## Key Policy Milestones:

- **2015**: Sweden accepts over 160,000 refugees.
- **2016-2018**: Introduction of temporary border controls and asylum restrictions.
- **2019-present**: Stricter immigration laws and integration policies.

# Environmental Pressures in Refugee Integration

The influx of refugees has placed significant strain on Sweden's public services, housing, and environmental resources. Refugee-hosting areas, especially urban centers, have faced challenges in providing adequate housing, healthcare, and educational services. Additionally, Sweden’s commitment to environmental sustainability has been tested by these growing demands.
